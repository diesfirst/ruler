  * Too many digits in number. jlait suggested ftrim?
  * Hotkey to copy value into paste buffer. Possibly
    just do it automatically. Or have toggle on the 
    toolbar to turn this on.
  * Snapping. See if it can respect houdini snapping.
  * Indication to tell user where indicator will start.
    I think this is the weakest one... the arrow
    already does a good job of this and doesn't need
    extra draw calls... need more reason on this.
  * A way to make the line thinner thicker.
    Again kind of weak. But sure.
  * Field on the tool bar to store the last measurement
  * A way to snap to an axis. I believe this means interest
    with a plane. Going to do anyway.
  * Keep ruler on screen until exit.
  * A button to write the ruler geo out with a 
    ruler sop.
